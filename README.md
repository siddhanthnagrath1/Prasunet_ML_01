# Prasunet_ML_01
# Prasunet Company Task 1

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is presumably from the Kaggle House Prices competition.

## Project Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Predictions on Test Data

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- SciPy
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary dependencies using:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scipy scikit-learn

# Usage
- Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>






- Ensure you have the required datasets (train.csv and test.csv) in the project directory.



- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Prasunet_Company_Task1.ipynb
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis and prediction steps.
# Notebook Structure
# 1.Import Libraries:

- Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
# 2.Load Data:

- Load the training and test datasets.
# 3.Data Cleaning:

- Drop unnecessary columns.
- Handle missing values.
# 4.Feature Engineering:

- Perform feature engineering to create new features and prepare the data for modeling.
# 5.Data Preprocessing:

- Encode categorical features.
- Scale numerical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
# 6.Model Training and Evaluation:

- Train a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluate the model using R2 score and RMSE.
# 7.Prediction on Test Data:

- Preprocess the test data.
- Make predictions and save the results.
# Results
The Linear Regression model's performance is evaluated using the R2 score and RMSE.
Predictions are made on the test data and saved in a DataFrame.
